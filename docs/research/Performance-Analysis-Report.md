## 4. Visual Trend Analysis
- **H1 2025 (Establishment):** Slow, organic build-up.
- **Q3 2025 (Expansion):** Impressions tripled from June to September.
- **Q4 2025 (Consolidation):** Steady traffic around 170-180 clicks/month.
- **Jan 2026 (Breakout):** A surge in visibility, likely due to ranking improvements for high-volume keywords or seasonal demand for legal services (start of year legal procedures).

## 5. Geographic Analysis (GEO)
The traffic is highly targeted and relevant, with the vast majority coming from the primary market.

| Country | Clicks | Impressions | CTR | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ecuador** | **587** | **18,267** | **3.21%** | **Primary Market.** Excellent reach. |
| **United States** | 36 | 3,268 | 1.10% | likely Ecuadorian diaspora looking for legal services back home. |
| **Spain** | 20 | 586 | 3.41% | Significant diaspora population. High CTR suggests strong intent. |
| **Switzerland** | 4 | 27 | 14.81% | Small but highly engaged audience. |

**Insight:** The presence in USA and Spain confirms the *migrant/diaspora market* is a viable secondary target for legal services (e.g., powers of attorney, property transfers from abroad).

## 6. AI & Search Features Visibility
**1. Google "AI Overviews" (Search):**
- **Data Source:** Google Search Console "Search Appearance".
- **Status:** The file `Aparición en búsquedas.csv` is **empty**.
- **Conclusion:** Your site has **not** noticeably appeared in Google's *generated* AI answers (the text block at the top of search results). This is common for sites focused on "tools" (calculators) rather than long-form "answers".

**2. External AI Models (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude):**
- **Data Source:** This data is **NOT** available in Google Search Console. GSC *only* tracks Google Search.
- **Probability:** Low to Medium.
- **Why?** LLMs (Large Language Models) use top-ranking pages as training data. Since you rank **Top 3-8** for queries like *"calculadora notarial"*, it is *possible* these models have read your site, but we cannot measure it here.
- **How to verify:** You would need to check your **Server Logs** or **Google Analytics** for "Referral" traffic from `chatgpt.com` or `gemini.google.com`.

**Growth Opportunity:** To be cited by AIs, you need to be the "Source of Truth".
- **Action:** Add a "Definitions" or "FAQ" section below your calculators.
- *Example:* "What is a notary calculator? It is a tool..." -> This text is what AIs read and cite.

## 7. Strategic Recommendations


1.  **Capitalize on Jan 2026 Momentum:** The surge in January suggests recent content or technical changes are paying off. Identify what changed in Dec/Jan and double down.
2.  **Optimize Low CTR / High Impression Queries:** With 12k impressions but 2.2% CTR, there is a huge opportunity to improve titles and meta descriptions to capture more of this existing visibility. *Note: Need query-level data to execute this.*
3.  **Content Expansion:** The site ranks well (Avg Pos 8.8). Publishing more content on related legal topics could easily rank given the domain's current authority and performance.
4.  **Conversion Optimization (CRO):** With 270+ monthly visitors, ensure the site has clear Calls to Action (WhatsApp buttons, Contact Forms) to convert this traffic into paying clients.
